# Twitch Chat Tool

### Welcome!

I made a tool for Twitch streamers with ony one monitor like myself while streaming! It allows you to put your chat OVER your games! Right now, it is quite ugly but is open source so feel free to update it how you would like!

### Usage

1. Start off by opening the executable and entering your Twitch username in the text box
2. Move the box where you would like it to be
3. Click the "Make Top Most" if you would like it to overlay Windowed Fullscreen games
4. Set your opacity scale (Make it see-through so it doesn't block your game as much)
5. Click "Hide Settings Box" and enjoy streaming with ease

### Questions or comments?

I don't check GitHub issue's very often, so feel free to [add me on Steam](steam://friends/add/76561198219057417)! I will be sure to answer questions or commends over there!

This entire project was created while streaming over at my Twitch! Join [my stream here!](https://Twitch.tv/Thaisen)
